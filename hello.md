# John's Profile

## A little about me
Hello! My name is John, and I am studying for computer engineering. I am originally from New Orleans, Louisiana. I moved here in 2005, evacuating from Hurricane Katrina, and have lived here since then.
## What I hope to get from this class
In this class, I am hoping to become more fluent in the C++ programming language. I have programmed some in C++, but I am not skilled at all in the language. I am much more effective in programming in other languages, but taking this course will help me learn another.
## My current programming skill
I currently know (but am *still* learning) the following languages:
* Assembly
* Batch
* C
* C#
* **Python** (I love this one)
  * I am currently working on making a video game in this language, to improve my generalas an exercise in programming logic skill. :space_invader: :video_game:
* VHDL
  * I am not currently programming in this language, but I enjoyed programming in it when I did.
## A little more about me
I have two pets, but unfortunately I only have a photo of one, currently. His name is Scout, and he is a Jack Russel Terrier mix:

I have played trumpet for a few years, and still do every once in a while. I also enjoy composing music, animating, reading, and *sometimes* I enjoy doing homework.
## My plans for the future
After graduating from the University of New Mexico, I might find a job here for a short time, then take some time to travel the world. Other than that, we'll see what's next! :earth_americas: :airplane:
